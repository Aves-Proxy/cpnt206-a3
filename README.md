### Helpful Resources
I found [this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2309819/how-to-stretch-a-header-across-a-web-page-background-with-css) to be useful for creating a solid-colored header and footer background that would reliably stretch accross the width of the page without interfering with my layout, which I had trouble doing. To find this resource again I would use the search term: **css stretch header background**.
